			<h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Dr. Carl Sagan's life:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>1934</strong> - Born in Brooklyn, New York, U.S</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1955</strong> - Receives B.S degree in Physics.</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1960</strong> - Earns a Ph.D with his thesis Physical Studies of Planets submitted to the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1960</strong> - Becomes a  Miller Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley. Meanwhile, he publishes an article in 1961 in the journal Science on the atmosphere of Venus, while also working with NASA's Mariner 2 team, and serves as a "Planetary Sciences Consultant" to the RAND Corporation. 
					</li>

					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1968</strong> - Sagan is denied tenure at Harvard. He later indicated that the decision was very much unexpected. The tenure denial has been blamed on several factors, including that he focused his interests too broadly across a number of areas (while the norm in academia is to become a renowned expert in a narrow specialty), and perhaps because of his well-publicized scientific advocacy, which some scientists perceived as borrowing the ideas of others for little more than self-promotion. An advisor from his years as an undergraduate student, Harold Urey, wrote a letter to the tenure committee recommending strongly against tenure for Sagan. 
					</li>
